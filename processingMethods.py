def apply_hough(img, threshold=100, minLineLength=150, maxLineGap=30):
    """
    Applies the probabilistic Hough transform on the given img with given parameters.
    Parameters have to be adjusted for the resolution of the image and charactertistics of the input image.
    The high-res images are recommened to be scaled down to no more than 1500 pixels on the longest dimension as the transform doesn not perform well for higher res images

    Example parameters that proved to be working in different settings:

    params_low_res_hough_prob = {"threshold": 100, "minLineLength":150, "maxLineGap":30} # use in case large images (more than 1000 pixels in width/heigh) # for images around 500 pixels width/lentgh
    params_high_res_hough_prob = {"threshold": 200, "minLineLength":150, "maxLineGap":25} # use in case large images (more than 1000 pixels in width/heigh) # for images around 1000 pixels width/length

    Parameters:
    ----------------------------
    img: np.array
        img in the form of a numpy array
    threshold: int
        The minimum number of intersections in hough space to "detect" a line. higher -> less lines
    minLineLength: int
        the minimum number of points that can form a line. Lines with less than this number of points are disregarded. higher -> less lines
    maxLineGap: int
        The maximum gap between two points to be considered in the same line. higher -> more lines

    Returns:
        hough_lines: np.array
            A 3 dimensional array of format [num_lines, 1, 4]. The last dimension stroes x_start, y_start , x_end, y_end of a line.
